# 30-Day DSA Training - Arrays, Strings, Matrices 💡


Welcome to the 30-Day Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Training led by Shreya Malogi! 🌟

This repository contains a collection of 100 resources and problems designed to help you build a strong foundation in DSA. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this training program is the perfect starting point.

## Why This Training? 😊

- Strengthen your DSA foundation: This training program is carefully structured to reinforce your understanding of arrays, strings, and matrices—the building blocks of many algorithms.

- Practical problem-solving: Each day, you'll dive into real-world coding challenges to apply what you've learned, gaining hands-on experience.

- Gradual progression: Problems are organized by difficulty, ensuring a smooth learning curve as you tackle increasingly complex challenges.

- Learn at your own pace: You have the flexibility to complete the training over 30 days, allowing you to balance learning with your schedule.

## Training Structure 👩‍💻

- **Day 1-10: Arrays** - Focus on array-related problems, understanding array manipulation, and solving problems that require efficient array operations.

- **Day 11-20: Strings** - Deepen your knowledge of strings, covering topics like string manipulation, pattern matching, and more.

- **Day 21-30: Matrices** - Explore matrix-related problems, including matrix transformations, traversals, and optimizations.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to the respective folders for each category (Arrays, Strings, Matrices) to find the problem descriptions and solutions.

2. Work on the problems in sequence, starting from Day 1 and progressing to Day 30.

3. Each problem is accompanied by a solution, but we encourage you to attempt solving it on your own before referring to the provided solution.

4. Feel free to adapt the code and experiment with your solutions.
